Thanks for registering for the upcoming Teens Learning Code workshop! There is no need to print a ticket or confirmation - we'll check you in electronically the day of the workshop.

We want to be able to dive right in and start learning at the workshop so there are a few things you need to prepare in advance below. Reminder, this workshop is BYOL so be sure to bring a laptop, power cord and computer mouse (if you're more comfortable using one than a trackpad).

HOW TO PREPARE:

1. Download a PyCharm Educational Edition https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/
2. Download the Learner Materials here: https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/teenslc-python/archive/master.zip and unzip. 
3. Look for installation instructions for windows/mac in the "installation" folder.


If you have any questions or comments there will be mentors available to help you on the day of the workshop.
Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop!

The Teens Learning Code Team
